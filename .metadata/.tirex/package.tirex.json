    "description": "<p>The SimpleLink™ CC13xx_CC26xx Software Development Kit (SDK) delivers components that enable engineers to develop applications on the Texas Instruments SimpleLink CC13xx and CC26xx family of wireless microcontroller (MCUs). This software toolkit provides a cohesive and consistent software experience for all SimpleLink CC13xx and CC26xx wireless MCU users by packaging essential software components, such as a Bluetooth® low energy (BLE) protocol stack supporting Bluetooth 5, Thread 1.1 networking stack based on OpenThread, ZigBee 3.0 compliant protocol suite, RF-Proprietary examples, TI's 15.4 Stack as well as the TI-RTOS kernel and TI Drivers in one easy-to-use software package along with example applications and documentation. In addition, the Dynamic Multi-Protocol Manager (DMM) software component enables multiprotocol development on a single SimpleLink wireless MCU through time division multiplexing. The SimpleLink MCU portfolio offers a single development environment that delivers flexible hardware, software and tool options for customers developing wired and wireless applications. With 100 percent code reuse across host MCUs, Wi-Fi™, Bluetooth low energy, Sub-1GHz devices and more, choose the MCU or connectivity standard that fits your design. A one-time investment with the SimpleLink software development kit (SDK) allows you to reuse often, opening the door to create unlimited applications.
